-Clone the repository.
-Open index.html in your web browser.
-Click on any movie title to view its details.
-Click "Buy Ticket" to purchase a ticket for the selected movie.

How it Works
The application fetches movie data from a JSON file and displays a list of movie titles. When a user clicks on a title, the application displays the corresponding movie details, including the title, runtime, poster image, showtime, description, and number of available tickets. The user can then click "Buy Ticket" to purchase a ticket for the movie. If there are no more available tickets, the "Buy Ticket" button will be disabled and display "SOLD OUT".
